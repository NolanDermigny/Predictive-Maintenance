# Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning

This project uses time series sensor data to predict machine failures. It explores classical ML models (Random Forests) and deep learning (LSTM) approaches.

## ðŸ’¡ Goals
- Explore IoT time series data
- Build predictive models to forecast failures
- Create a Streamlit dashboard for interactive inspection

## ðŸ”§ Tools
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Streamlit
